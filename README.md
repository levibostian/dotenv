# dotenv 

The easiest way to use `.env` values in your next project. A flexible CLI that reads your source code project and generates a new file with your `.env` values inside that you want. 

## How does it work? 

Let's say you have a `.env` file that looks like this:

```
STRIPE_API_KEY=4837394857859494
DEBUG=true
```

And you have the source code file:

```kotlin
class Example {
    val name = "dotenv CLI"
}
```

If you were to run the `dotenv` CLI on your source code, the CLI would generate a source code file that looks like this:

```kotlin
object Env {

}
```

That's right. It's empty. This is to prevent bloat but also security if you have information in your `.env` you don't want to expose to your project. If you want to use an environment variable in your source code, you need to first use it in your code:

```kotlin
class Example {
    val key = Env.stripeApiKey
}
```

Your compiler will complain at this time because you don't have a file `Env` with the variable `stripeApiKey`. But you need to define these variables to request from the `dotenv` CLI that you want to use an environment variable value. Now if you run the `dotenv` CLI, it will see `Env.stripeApiKey`, look for a environment variable `PROJECT_NAME` in the `.env` file, and generate:

```kotlin
object Env {
    val stripeApiKey = "4837394857859494"
}
```

## Getting started

This CLI is not meant to be used directly by your project (although you surely can do that). It's meant to be a CLI that does all the hard work while you are supposed to then create a wrapper around the CLI that's specific to your language of choice. That means that I recommend that instead of using this project directly you instead use one of the following:

* [dotenv-android](https://github.com/levibostian/dotenv-android)
* [dotenv-ios](https://github.com/levibostian/dotenv-ios)

That is it for now but there may be more in the future! 

...If you are still wondering how to get started with this project then here you go:

1. Install the CLI. (currently you must build from source but pre-built binaries are to come)

2. Use the CLI on your project. Use command `dotenv generate` to see the help docs printed to you on how to use the CLI. 

## Goals of this project

* **Be flexible and powerful.** This CLI is not meant to be convenient. Instead, this CLI is meant to do the heavy work for you and then we build language specific tools to be convenient. Like [dotenv-android](https://github.com/levibostian/dotenv-android) to make using `.env` files in your Android app very quick and easy. 
* **Binary form not relying on a specific programming language to execute.** We didn't want this project to be written in lets say Ruby to force the developer using it to have Ruby installed on their machine. Instead, have pre-built binaries created so developers could simply install the tool and run it. Some developer eco-systems like iOS/Swift are used to tools being written in Ruby so that wouldn't be a pain but for Typescript/node or Android eco-systems Ruby is not common. Binary is universal. 
* **Generate a source code file in X language where the input language can be X or Y.** Rather then assume that your project is written in Java and you want to generate Java code, why not give you the flexibility in outputting Kotlin from your Java source code? 

# Development 

* Compile code: 

```
go build
```

* Run tests: 

To make life easier, we recommend using [gotestsum](https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum#install) to run tests. 

```
gotestsum --format pkgname
```

### Add a new language 

At this time, I am not looking for this tool to get bloated with dozens of languages. The more we add, the more we have to maintain! If this repo becomes popular then I advice that we create a plugin system or something like it so people can create go modules that can plugin to the CLI to support X language. 

With that being said, this main repo is open to adding new languages:
* Javascript
* Typescript
* Swift
* Go

Why these languages? 
1. I ([levibostian](https://github.com/levibostian/)) the current maintainer knows these languages and can therefore maintain the code. 
2. I have been toying around with the idea of adding these languages to the project at some point anyway so I can use this tool for those projects. 

**How do we add a new language?**

The codebase has been designed to make adding new languages as easy as possible. This is done by encapsulating all programming language related code to 1-2 files. From there, the codebase takes care of the rest of the work for you. 

1. Your friend is the `lang/` directory. This is where all programming language related code exists. When you want to add a new language, create 2 new files: 
* `<lang-name>.go` (example: `typescript.go`)
* `<lang-name>_test.go` (example: `typescript_test.go`)

This is where the Go source code exists for the new language. 

2. In each of the 2 new files that you created, write all of the code needed for your language. Check out `./lang/langs.go` for comments documenting the interfaces and view the existing languages like `./lang/kotlin.go` for examples. 

3. Go into `./lang/langs.go` and follow the instructions in that file. It will tell you a couple of things that you need to do in that file to add your new lang to the CLI. 

4. Make a e2e test in directory `./e2e/`. See the examples already there. Think of a use case like generating Typescript from Typescript source and make a e2e test for that scenario. 

# Deployment 

* Make sure to set version number when compiling: `go build -ldflags "-X main.version=1.0.1"`
* Set environment variables:
1. `REPO_PUSH_TOKEN` - github personal access token with `repos` permission access. 
2. `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` - username for dockerhub to push docker images. 
3. `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` - docker hub token to authenticate with account.
